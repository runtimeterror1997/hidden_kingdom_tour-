          Traveling to Bhutan is akin to stepping into a living museum where the past and present blend seamlessly. The Kingdom, though small in size, offers an incredible diversity of landscapes, cultures, and experiences. From the western valleys, which are the cradle of the country's modernization, to the spiritual heartland of the center, and the rugged, untouched beauty of the east, every district in Bhutan has its own unique character and charm.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bhutan is divided into 20 districts (Dzongkhags), each with its own administrative center and fortress (Dzong). For the traveler, the country is generally categorized into three main regions: Western, Central, and Eastern Bhutan.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-primary mb-6">Western Bhutan: The Gateway</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Western Bhutan is the most accessible and frequently visited region of the country. It is home to the only international airport in Paro and the capital city, Thimphu. This region serves as the cultural and economic hub of the nation, characterized by terraced rice fields, apple orchards, and some of the country's most magnificent fortresses.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Paro Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Paro is often the first point of entry for visitors. The valley is wide and verdant, recognized as one of the most beautiful in the country. It is home to the <strong>Paro Taktsang (Tiger's Nest)</strong>, Bhutan's most iconic landmark. Perched precariously on a cliff 900 meters above the valley floor, legend has it that Guru Rinpoche flew here on the back of a tigress to subdue a local demon.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Other significant sites include the <strong>Rinpung Dzong</strong>, a fortress that exemplifies Bhutanese architecture with its massive buttressed walls and intricate woodwork. The National Museum, housed in the ancient watchtower (Ta Dzong) above the main fortress, offers a deep dive into Bhutan's history, showcasing ancient thangkas, weapons, and stamps.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Thimphu Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                An hour's drive from Paro lies Thimphu, the bustling capital. It is perhaps the only national capital in the world without traffic lights; instead, white-gloved policemen elegantly direct traffic with hand motions. Thimphu is a unique blend of the old and new. You will find red-robed monks using smartphones and traditional mud-rammed houses standing next to modern concrete buildings.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Key attractions include the <strong>Tashichho Dzong</strong>, the seat of the government and the office of the King. The giant <strong>Buddha Dordenma</strong> statue, sitting atop a hill overlooking the valley, is one of the largest Buddha rupas in the world, housing 125,000 smaller Buddhas inside. The Folk Heritage Museum and the Textile Museum provide fascinating insights into the daily life and artistic traditions of the Bhutanese people.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Punakha Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Descending from the high pass of Dochu La (3,100m), where 108 memorial chortens stand against a backdrop of Himalayan peaks, one reaches the subtropical valley of Punakha. This was the capital of Bhutan until 1955 and remains the winter residence of the Central Monastic Body.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                The <strong>Punakha Dzong</strong> (Palace of Great Happiness) is arguably the most beautiful fortress in the country. Built at the confluence of the Pho Chhu (Male River) and Mo Chhu (Female River), it is a masterpiece of Bhutanese architecture. In spring, the lilac jacaranda trees bloom around the dzong, creating a breathtaking sight. Nearby is the Chimi Lhakhang, the temple of the "Divine Madman," associated with fertility blessings.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Haa Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                To the south of Paro lies the Haa Valley. Opened to tourism only in 2002, Haa remains one of the least visited areas in western Bhutan, offering a pristine and traditional experience. The valley is known for its Guardian Deities and the annual Haa Summer Festival, which celebrates the nomadic lifestyle of the region.

        <div className="my-12">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-primary mb-6">Central Bhutan: The Spiritual Heartland</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Central Bhutan is the spiritual pulse of the nation. It was here that Buddhism first took root, and the region is dotted with some of the oldest and most sacred temples in the Himalayas. The pace of life here is slower, and the landscapes are dominated by broad, U-shaped valleys carved by ancient glaciers.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Trongsa Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Trongsa is the geographic center of Bhutan. The <strong>Trongsa Dzong</strong> is a massive structure that commands the landscape, stretching along a ridge above a deep gorge. Historically, this fortress controlled the trade routes between east and west, making the Penlop (Governor) of Trongsa the most powerful figure in the country. The first two Kings ruled from here, and it is still tradition for the Crown Prince to serve as the Penlop of Trongsa before ascending the throne.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Bumthang Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Bumthang is often referred to as the "Switzerland of Bhutan" due to its stunning scenery of rolling hills and pine forests. Detailed exploration of Bumthang reveals it is actually a complex of four valleys: Chhume, Choekhor, Tang, and Ura.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                This region is the most sacred in Bhutan, home to holy sites like <strong>Jambay Lhakhang</strong> (built in the 7th century) and <strong>Kurjey Lhakhang</strong>, where Guru Rinpoche left his body imprint on a rock. The valley is also famous for its production of honey, cheese, fruit juices, and the famous "Red Panda" Weissbier locally brewed.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                The Burning Lake (Mebar Tsho) in the Tang Valley is a significant pilgrimage site where the saint Pema Lingpa famously dove into the water with a burning butter lamp and emerged with the lamp still lit, holding a treasure chest and a scroll of paper.

        <div className="my-12">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-primary mb-6">Eastern Bhutan: The Unexplored Frontier</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Eastern Bhutan is a region of raw, rugged beauty. It is less developed than the west, offering adventurous travelers a glimpse into a Bhutan that has remained largely unchanged for centuries. The people here, primarily Sharchops, are known for their warmth, hospitality, and distinctive silk textiles.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Mongar Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                The journey to the east crosses the high Thrumshing La pass (3,800m), descending through changing vegetation zones into Mongar. Mongar town is built on the side of a hill, and unlike other towns in Bhutan, there is hardly any flat land. The Mongar Dzong is modern compared to others, built in the 1930s, yet it maintains the traditional architectural style without the use of nails or drawings.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Trashigang Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Trashigang is the largest district in Bhutan. The <strong>Trashigang Dzong</strong>, or "The Fortress of the Auspicious Hill," overlooks the confluence of the Drangme Chhu and Gamri Chhu rivers. It serves as the administrative center for the region. The district is also the gateway to Merak and Sakteng, the semi-nomadic regions famously known as the home of the Yeti (Migoi) and distinct high-altitude cultures.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Trashiyangtse Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                To the north of Trashigang lies Trashiyangtse. It famous for the <strong>Chorten Kora</strong>, a stupa modelled after the Boudhanath stupa in Nepal. It is also the home of the National Institute for Zorig Chusum (School of 13 Arts and Crafts), where students learn the traditional art of wood turning to make lacquered wooden bowls (dapa) which are prized throughout the country.
            </p>

             <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Lhuentse Dzongkhag</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Lhuentse is one of the most isolated districts. It is the ancestral home of the Wangchuck dynasty and is famous for its intricate Kishuthara textiles. The landscape is dramatic, with steep cliffs and deep gorges. A towering statue of Guru Rinpoche at Takila, standing 154 feet tall, is a new pilgrimage site that attracts devotees from across the world.
